The president of the blind association of the Istrian County asked me to make a timer that will help them count the time during their chess playing. The application was made in the simplest way to make it as easy as possible for them. The application was made in VS Code (JS & HTML). The link for the application is: https://cheeess-timer.netlify.app/
